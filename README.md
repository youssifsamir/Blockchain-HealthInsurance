## Overview

By integrating the technologies used bellow, this project ensures:
  - A mobile-friendly user interface.
  - Streamlined medical insurance claiming process.
  - Utilization of Ethereum blockchain for enhanced security and transparency.
  - Exploration of blockchain oracle technology to address heterogeneity issues.
    
By incorporating blockchain technology, I seek to improve the security and transparency of medical insurance claims.</br>
The utilization of Ethereum allows for a decentralized and tamper-resistant system. Additionally, the project explores blockchain oracle technology to address the heterogeneity issue in blockchain communication. This aspect is crucial for ensuring interoperability and seamless communication between different components within the blockchain network.
